Title: Introduction to C++ and OOPS, Variables, Data Types, I/O Operations Tools: MS Visual Studio Code

# Overview
This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Each program is designed to build a strong foundation in C++ by exploring key elements like input/output operations, data types, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

# 1. Hello, World! Program
This is the classic starting point for learning any programming language. The "Hello, World!" program demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ application, including:

Use of #include <iostream> for input/output operations.
The main() function as the entry point.

Use of cout to display output on the console.
SampleOutput:

Hello World!
Have a good day!

# Purpose:
To understand how to print text and get familiar with the syntax and structure of a simple C++ program.

# 2. Simple Calculator
This program acts as a basic command-line calculator that performs the four fundamental arithmetic operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Functionality:

Takes two floating-point numbers as input from the user using cin.
Performs each arithmetic operation and stores the results in variables.
Displays the output clearly with appropriate labels.
SampleOutput:

Enter the first number:45

Enter the second number:90

Sum of given numbers: 135

The product of num1 and num2 is: 4050

The division of num1 and num2 is: 0.5

The subtraction of num1 and num2 is: -45

Conclusion
These programs form the backbone of learning C++. They not only teach the syntax but also the logic-building necessary for more complex programming tasks. As a beginner, mastering these will make it easier to tackle topics like loops, arrays, functions, and object-oriented programming in future modules.
